		<p id="content"><br>Welcome to my webpage.<br>I am Mary Korkor Teye a freshman at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology studying Aerospace Engineering. I attended Duke international school for my primary education, Valley View University Basic School for my junior high school education and University Practice Senior High School for my senior high school education. I love reading and the idea of builing things excites me. I also strongly believe that the waste generated in society can be recycled into other forms of energy. I believe can be turned into reality.</p>
